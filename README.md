# Data Structures (C++)

### 1. Singly Linked List
- **Focus:** Dynamic memory management (`new`/`delete`), pointer manipulation.
- **Features:** Insertion/deletion at any position, search, and an efficient reverse algorithm.

### 2. Stack (Array-based)
- **Principle:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).
- **Features:** Template-based implementation with standard `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations.

### 3. Queue (Circular Array)
- **Principle:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out).
- **Features:** Efficient use of space using a circular buffer logic.

### 4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
- **Principle:** Support for insertion and deletion from both ends.
- **Features:** Combines the functionality of both Stack and Queue.
